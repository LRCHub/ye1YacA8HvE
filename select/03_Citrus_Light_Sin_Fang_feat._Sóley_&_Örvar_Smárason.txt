Only lovers lie
You won't have the time
To calm your skinny life

Blindly fit me in
My head is full of lonely voice
With lonely hearts

Should I let them in?
Won't you come by the yellow boat tonight?
Just to see that I'm in love with a different eye

I can't answer now
Fingers don't know how
To say no

Find me in the dark
My head is full of blaring noise
That echoes round

Should I let it out?
Won't you come by the yellow olden light?
Just to witness my love by citrus light
