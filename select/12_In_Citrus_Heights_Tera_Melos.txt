Flying outward is a drag
You don't have to come back
Catch a cold in a head wound
In the middle of a warzone

Oh what did you take
Suburban noise
Naked crystal friends
The neighborhoods
Don't know where to pay
My penalty
Drop a holy name
Atomic wave wave wave

See, what it is
Savoring, it's a
Fantasy
What's not
See
What is

Carpet, spit and melt it
Dripping with colors
Can you picture that stereo?
Pick up the stench
I guess so

Oh what what did you take,
Suburban noise
Naked crystal friends
The neighborhoods
Don't wanna decay
The coveted
Gotta work the day
No time to play way way way

See what is
Savoring
It's so
Fantasy
What's not
See
What is

And bugs always wonder why
Policeman doesn't wanna die
The letterman let you live inside

Born with nothing to lose
Scored with three tattoos x 2

Plastic figurine
Shielding them inside
Keeps them safe at night
She took it down
From the stoop it set
Put it in the trash

Plastic figurines
Shielding them inside
Keeps them safe at night
She took it down
From the silver side
Buried for All
