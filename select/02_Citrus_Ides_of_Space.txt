You live up where the air is light
You wouldn't know but I might
It's not your fault, it was night
And you can't speka for your sight

But if you second guess your way to the ground
Can you help me find my way around?

If the long way to go is all that you know
Pretend not to hear
I'll meet you back here
Don't ever forget there's time to ignore
The pictures that they'll draw

But if you second guess your way to the ground
Can you help me find my way around?

If the long way to go is all that you know
Pretend not to hear
I'll meet you back here
Don't ever forget there's time to ignore
The pictures that they'll draw

If the long way to go is all that you know
Pretend not to hear
I'll meet you back here
Don't ever forget there's time to ignore
The pictures that they'll draw
